                               WARNING

  I have compiled these binaries using the mingw32 cross-compiler on Linux,
  i.e., "blindly"--I no longer have the ability to test Win32 executables,
  so I have no clue whether they actually work.  (I have no strong reason
  to believe they _don't_ work other than the fact that they've never been
  tested; perhaps there are Unix-specific assumptions baked into the source
  code.  That appears to be true for five printf() statements that use the
  "%td" format for ptrdiff_t--i.e., pointer differences, i.e., subtraction--
  which doesn't seem to be supported under Windows.  And color mode may require
  ANSI.SYS or its modern equivalent to be loaded.)

  Anyway, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN!  But feel free to let me know if they either work
  or don't work; I _might_ be able to fix things, as long as I have sufficient
  information and someone willing to be the guinea pig and, oh yes, spare time
  and interest in and general awareness of your email. ;-)


See the main README file for basic instructions on compiling and running the
programs.  See http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/apps/pngcheck.html for further
information and for links to the source code.  Makefile.mingw32 and
Makefile.mingw64 (new since the 2.3.0 and 3.0.2 releases, respectively) are
included for reference.
