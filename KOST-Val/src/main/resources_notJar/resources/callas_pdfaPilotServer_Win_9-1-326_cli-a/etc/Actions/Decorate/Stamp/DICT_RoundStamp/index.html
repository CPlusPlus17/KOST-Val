		This fragment controls how the stamp will look:
		- img: the image used as a background. You can link to any image, PDF or SVG file here
		- p: the three pieces of text. You can change the word "RECEIVED" to your own text if
		     you want. The other two pieces of text are replaced automatically by what is passed
		     in from pdfaPilot.

		The placement here can be controlled in the "scripts.js" file. Look for the variables 
		at the top of the file.
